    <h3><strong>Design elements</strong></h3>
	<h5><strong>Color justification</strong></h5>
	<p><ul>
	<li><span class="border border-secondary px-2 color-block" style="background-color: #24a200;"></span> #24a200 - Reform stands for self-growth and the brand logo contains a plant in this green color. Bright green stands for renewal and rebirth based off the new growth and revitalization of plant life.</li>
	<li><span class="border border-secondary px-2 color-block" style="background-color: #201c1c;"></span> #201c1c - Using this colour shade, we wanted to create a modest and mature colour scheme.

	<li><span class="border border-secondary px-2 color-block" style="background-color: #ffffff;"></span> #ffffff - The color white relates to space for making mistakes, which we give to our customers. It is also associated with self-acceptance which is one of our brand values.</li>
		</ul></p>
</div>	
	<div class="container py-2">
    <h5><strong>Font justification</strong></h5>
		<p>As our main font, we chose <strong>Montserrat</strong> because this font has very clean lines and its geometric design gives it a contemporary feel, making it suitable for our target audience as it correlates to something 'new'. Additionally, this font is available in different weights and styles, allowing for flexibility in usage and design. Furthermore, we chose Montserrat because it has a great readability due to its well-proportioned letters (medium.com, 2023).</p>

  <p>This campaign was aimed at introducing and strengthening our brand its presence on social media platforms, in particular Instagram, TikTok and Facebook.

	<h3><strong>Learning Points</strong></h3>
	<h5><strong>What we have learned</strong></h5>
	<p><strong>Platform-specific strategies:</strong> Each social media platform requires a different approach to optimize engagement. For example, TikTok's short, creative videos attracted a lot of attention, while Instagram posts and stories were more effective for detailed content and direct interaction.</p>
<p><strong>Audience engagement timing:</strong> Posting posts in the evenings significantly increased interactions, which validated our decision to align content scheduling with audience engagement patterns. </p>  
	<h5><strong>What worked</strong></h5>
	<p><strong>Visual Consistency:</strong> Consistent use of brand colors, logos and hashtags across all platforms drove brand awareness and trust.</p>
	<p><strong>Interactive content:</strong> Surveys, Q&A sessions and user-generated content effectively engaged audiences and provided valuable feedback for future campaigns.</p>
	<h5><strong>What did not work</strong></h5>
	<p><strong>Limited use of the platform:</strong> Initial focus primarily on Instagram limited our overall reach. Engaging TikTok and Facebook from the beginning could have expanded our audience more effectively.</p>
	<p><strong>Short campaign duration:</strong> A two-week campaign was not enough to gain significant momentum and reach our target reach. A longer campaign duration would have given more time for audience growth and engagement.</p>
	<h5><strong>What worked out as expected</strong></h5>
	<p><strong>Instagram engagement:</strong> High engagement rates with posts and stories confirmed our choice of Instagram as our primary platform.</p>
	<p><strong>Community Building:</strong> Successfully built a sense of community around our brand values, validated by user-generated content and repeated interactions.</p>
	<h5><strong>What did not meet expectations</strong></h5>
	<p><strong>Overall reach:</strong> Failure to reach the 2,000 goal indicated the need for a broader, multi-platform strategy and more aggressive promotional tactics.</p>
	<p><strong>Engagement metrics:</strong> While engagement rates were high, converting them into tangible subscriber growth was a challenge.</p>
	<h5><strong>What would be done differently</strong></h5>
	<p><strong>Increase use of platforms:</strong> Use a multi-platform approach from the start to maximize reach and take advantage of each platform's unique strengths. 
Increase campaign length: Increase campaign length to allow more time for audience engagement and growth.</p>
	<p><strong>Publish more frequently:</strong> Implement a more regular publishing schedule across all platforms to maintain consistent engagement and audience retention.</p>
	<br>
	<p>By reflecting on these points, we gained valuable insights to optimize future campaigns to better achieve our marketing goals and build a stronger community around the Reform brand. </p>	
</div>
<div class="container py-2">
	<h3><strong>Reflection on the campaign</strong></h3>
<p>The marketing campaign its core message centered around self-reflection and self-acceptance, embodied in the slogan "Celebrate your mistakes. " The campaign included posts, stories, and reels on Instagram, which were strategically scheduled after 17:00, as well as with the peak activity of our audience. Every post was written to stick to the brand values and included our logo and relevant hashtags to increase its visibility.
Nevertheless, the campaign did not achieve the goal of getting 2000 people by April 15th, as the reach was only 75. This discrepancy highlighted several areas for improvement:
	<p><ul>
	<li><strong>Platform limitation:</strong> This restriction to only using Instagram was our main weakness. Our polls also showed that the other platforms our target demographic used were TikTok and Facebook.</li>
	<li><strong>Content variety:</strong> Although posts and stories received engagement, reels were less explored and could have engaged more with dynamic content.</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> There needed to be more than two weeks of campaign period to create the much-needed buzz and audience participation.</li>
	</ul></p>
</p>
  </div>
<div class="container py-2">
	<h3><strong>Future planning</strong></h3>
<p>Building on the insights from our initial campaign, several strategies can enhance future marketing efforts:
	<p><ul>
	<li><strong>Expand social media platforms:</strong> &nbsp;Consider using TikTok since it is popular among the target demographic and Facebook. Studies also show that the target population widely accesses these platforms. Combining these platforms would mean using one platform to promote the other; it is possible that this would double the traffic (Scorpion, 2023). TikTok its approach to short informative videos and Facebook its wider audience reach could expand and enhance the campaign its reach. In addition to expanding the platforms, added visuals should also be put into consideration. For instance, the use of animations to bring the brand its message to life, lifestyle photography to showcase other people embracing themselves, and infographics to pass the brand its message in a visually appealing manner.</li>
	<li><strong>Enhance content strategy:</strong> More posts can increase the engagement level, and the diversification of the posts presented can also help. It is possible to add various forms of content like product information, brand values, customers' stories, quizzes, questions, and answers to maintain the audience's interest. For instance, sharing behind-the-scenes content exhibiting the processes involved in running the Reform brand would likely give the audience a more personal connection to the brand and its values.  It is also essential to post on certain days of the week; for instance, the weekend, when people have more time to spend online, can also help create a posting routine.</li>
	<li><strong>Utilize analytics and feedback:</strong> Monitoring the engagement level and collecting the audience's feedback regularly is essential. Using Instagram Insights, one can get information regarding the performance of the post, the audience, and the engagement rate. It should inform the changes in content and the alterations in the strategies used. For instance, if posts about brand values elicit more engagement, more such content should be made.</li>
	<li><strong>Longer campaign duration:</strong> It is also important not to set the campaign for less than two weeks because it can limit the target audience's potential exposure. This way, the audience will be retained for a long time, and there will be constant interaction, hence the continuous engagement. Periodically analyzing the campaign and making modifications based on the results will assist in meeting the outlined objectives (Scorpion, 2023).</li>
	<li><strong>Incorporate user-generated content:</strong> It is recommended to actively invite users to share their materials related to the brand on social networks, as this will increase the organic coverage rate. User-generated content provides a genuine recommendation, which can help create a feeling of togetherness among the brand's followers. This effect can be further enhanced by running contests or challenges where users produce content with the help of brand hashtags.</li>
	<li><strong>Refine target audience engagement</strong> Further segmenting the target population can help understand them better and, in turn, customize the campaign (Zotara, 2023). Communicating with various target groups through specific content and interactions can improve the bond with the brand. For instance, reaching out to particular posts to a segment that has specific interests or behaviors will make the campaign more relevant to that segment.</li>
	</ul></p>
</p>
  </div>
<div class="container py-2">
	<h3><strong>Detailed process improvements</strong></h3>
	<p>Reflecting on the process, several adjustments can enhance the campaign's effectiveness based on our experience:
	<p><ul>
	<li><strong>Content planning and creation:</strong> The content should be designed to be appealing and professionally done. Beautiful images and videos that align with the brand's image can attract more viewers' attention and deliver our message.</li>
	<li><strong>Monitoring and analytics:</strong> Use social media analysis features to track interactions and optimize the approaches used in social networks. It is thus essential to assess the performance frequently to discover what strategies are more effective and adapt the campaign accordingly.</li>
	<li><strong>Community building:</strong> The emphasis should be on creating a community based around the brand. By responding to followers' comments and direct messages and participating in community activities, the customer base can be built, and people will promote the brand.</li>
	<li><strong>Learning from mistakes:</strong> On this basis, one should learn from one's mistakes and work toward the campaign's main principle. Recording a campaign's progress or lack of progress can be helpful in future endeavors.</li>
	</ul></p>
</p>
  </div>
<div class="container py-2">
	<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
	<p>These were the key messages of the first series of Reform's marketing campaigns: the achievements and the challenges. The subsequent campaigns can also increase engagement by using more platforms, improving the content, prolonging the campaign, and using targeted ads and interactive features. Implementing these recommendations and considering the process will ensure that our marketing communicates the brand's message and values and builds a supportive community.</p>
