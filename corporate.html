    <h3><strong>Design elements</strong></h3>
	<h5><strong>Color justification</strong></h5>
	<p><ul>
	<li><span class="border border-secondary px-2 color-block" style="background-color: #24a200;"></span> #24a200 - Reform stands for self-growth and the brand logo contains a plant in this green color. Bright green stands for renewal and rebirth based off the new growth and revitalization of plant life.</li>
	<li><span class="border border-secondary px-2 color-block" style="background-color: #201c1c;"></span> #201c1c - Using this colour shade, we wanted to create a modest and mature colour scheme. Our brand is about learning from mistakes and being self-reflective which translates to being mature and modest.</li>
	<li><span class="border border-secondary px-2 color-block" style="background-color: #ffffff;"></span> #ffffff - The color white relates to space for making mistakes, which we give to our customers. It is also associated with self-acceptance which is one of our brand values.</li>
		</ul></p>
</div>	
	<div class="container py-2">
    <h5><strong>Font justification</strong></h5>
		<p>As our main font, we chose <strong>Montserrat</strong> because this font has very clean lines and its geometric design gives it a contemporary feel, making it suitable for our target audience as it correlates to something 'new'. Additionally, this font is available in different weights and styles, allowing for flexibility in usage and design. Furthermore, we chose Montserrat because it has a great readability due to its well-proportioned letters.</p>

	<h2><strong>MARKETING</strong></h2>
  <h3><strong>Campaign context</strong></h3>
  <p>This campaign was aimed at introducing and strengthening our brand its presence on social media platforms, in particular Instagram, TikTok and Facebook. The main idea was to consider mistakes as opportunities for growth and learning, which is in line with the spirit of our brand - self-reflection and self-improvement.

<div class="container py-2">
  <h3><strong>Objectives</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Specific</strong>: Facebook Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook Reach 2,000 people by April 15th with a strategic social media campaign. This target is based on a study conducted by Statista, according to which the average coverage of accounts with fewer than 10,000 subscribers is 30% (Statista, 2023).</p>
  <p><strong>Measurable</strong>: Measure success using key performance indicators (KPIs) such as reach, engagement (likes, comments, posts), subscriber growth, and website traffic through social media.</p>
  <p><strong>Achievable</strong>: The conclusions obtained as a result of comprehensive marketing research and initial consumer surveys indicate that the established goal is true, given the noted high level of engagement of the target audience on these platforms.</p>
	<p><strong>Relevant</strong>: This goal fits well into a broader marketing framework aimed at increasing brand awareness and stimulating community growth that reflects the core values that underpin it.</p>

	<h3><strong>Learning Points and Reflection</strong></h3>
	<h5><strong>What we have learned</strong></h5>
	<p><strong>Platform-specific strategies</strong>: Each social media platform requires a different approach to optimize engagement. For example, TikTok's short, creative videos attracted a lot of attention, while Instagram posts and stories were more effective for detailed content and direct interaction.</p>
<p><strong>Audience engagement timing</strong>: Posting posts in the evenings significantly increased interactions, which validated our decision to align content scheduling with audience engagement patterns. </p>  
	<h5><strong>What worked</strong></h5>
	<p><strong>Visual Consistency</strong>: Consistent use of brand colors, logos and hashtags across all platforms drove brand awareness and trust.</p>
	<p><strong>Interactive content</strong>: Surveys, Q&A sessions and user-generated content effectively engaged audiences and provided valuable feedback for future campaigns.</p>
	<h5><strong>What did not work</strong></h5>
	<p><strong>Limited use of the platform</strong>: Initial focus primarily on Instagram limited our overall reach. Engaging TikTok and Facebook from the beginning could have expanded our audience more effectively.</p>
	<p><strong>Short campaign duration</strong>: A two-week campaign was not enough to gain significant momentum and reach our target reach. A longer campaign duration would have given more time for audience growth and engagement.</p>
	<h5><strong>What worked out as expected</strong></h5>
	<p><strong>Instagram engagement</strong>: High engagement rates with posts and stories confirmed our choice of Instagram as our primary platform.</p>
	<p><strong>Community Building</strong>: Successfully built a sense of community around our brand values, validated by user-generated content and repeated interactions.</p>
	<h5><strong>What did not meet expectations</strong></h5>
	<p><strong>Overall reach</strong>: Failure to reach the 2,000 goal indicated the need for a broader, multi-platform strategy and more aggressive promotional tactics.</p>
	<p><strong>Engagement metrics</strong>: While engagement rates were high, converting them into tangible subscriber growth was a challenge.</p>
	<h5><strong>What would be done differently</strong></h5>
	<p><strong>Increase use of platforms</strong>: Use a multi-platform approach from the start to maximize reach and take advantage of each platform's unique strengths. 
Increase campaign length: Increase campaign length to allow more time for audience engagement and growth.</p>
	<p><strong>Publish more frequently</strong>: Implement a more regular publishing schedule across all platforms to maintain consistent engagement and audience retention.</p>
	<br>
	<p>By reflecting on these points, we gained valuable insights to optimize future campaigns to better achieve our marketing goals and build a stronger community around the Reform brand. </p>
